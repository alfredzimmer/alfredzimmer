Hi there! This is Alfred from Shanghai.

Do ignore the fact that I haven't been coding that much. [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) has earned the credit for it :). 

I mostly did full-stack but am currently learning Rust and Machine Learning and a whole bunch of math in fear of being replaced by AI.
